# Eastern-Bluebird-Map

Here's the GitHub Pages link: https://bradyfish.github.io/BirdMapping/

Mouse over the icon on the top right to change the layers. If you click on a point, it displays the graph for Eastern Bluebirds over the last 20 years of the state.

Tree swallow success data also exists, though there was not enough time to add graphs.

The thing that actually generates the html file is Birdmap.py.
