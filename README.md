# Eastern-Bluebird-Map

Team Members: Jake Dreher, Logan Potts, Charlie Roth

Here's the GitHub Pages link: https://bradynichols.github.io/BirdMapping/

Shows nest success for all native states for tree swallows and eastern bluebirds.

Mouse over the icon on the top right to change the layers. If you click on a point, it displays the graph for Eastern Bluebirds over the last 20 years of the state.

For all the points to be accurate, remove the "Tree Swallows" layer. Then, the points will line up with the Eastern Bluebird choropleth.

Tree swallow success data also exists, though there was not enough time to add graphs.

The thing that actually generates the html file is Birdmap.py.
